## Use Case Abstract
<!--- Template Instructions  
This project solves the accessibility issue that is selecting a product on a bank website. We feel that the selection of a product is the first drop of point for any potential accessibility issues. There is a range of things that can overwhelm a content consumer. Our solution is that universal design is added to all steps of the solution. A quiz asks them what they are looking for in a product in broken down steps, provides them with the knowledge they need to make an informed decision, and on how they can compare products.
This project is important, in part, gaining back the Â£935 million that Banks and Building Societies lose every month due to accessibility issues.
(https://wearepurple.org.uk/the-purple-pound-infographic/)
Any customer with accessibility needs must fill out an application form for a product. First, they have to select a product causing this to be the first dropout point. We have decided to focus on dyslexia as it is a disability that affects at least 1 in 10 people.  Over 6 million individuals in the UK alone have dyslexia and may not even have received a diagnosis yet.  35% of U.S. entrepreneurs suffer from dyslexia, and  20% in the UK. So they are customers that have a need for the bank's services. Without our solution, the bank loses valuable and potentially loyal customers.

So we propose to use the Atomic theme builder to provide a need base experience to Charlie.
